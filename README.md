# Quantum Crush #
We are team Quantum Codebreakers and this project was made as part of IMB Qiskit Fall Fest 2023 conducted by QCG IITR.

## Team Members ##
* Vineet Kumar
* Shourya Goel (aka Batmnan)
* Parvathi Nair
* Atul Kumar

## Project Motivation ##

Our Main Motivation was to give an average student the power to unlock the quantum world with a game that breaks down complexity, offers visual insight, and opens the door to quantum computing for all, fueling fierce competition and unquenchable motivation!

## Project Idea ##
The game of Quantum Crush was made for educating people about interaction of quantum states with quantum gates. The idea was to make a multi level game with increasing difficulty. For winning each level, the player needs to reduce the different states present in the starting of the game to one state, by applying the gates present along the border of the grid on the states, to make them same as the adjacent state. As more difficult levels come, lifelines will be given to player to change the gates or creating one's own gates.
